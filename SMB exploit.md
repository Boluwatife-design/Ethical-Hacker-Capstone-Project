Discover if there are any unsecured shared directories located on an SMB server in the 10.5.5.0/24 network.

# Step 1: Scan for potential targets running SMB
- Use scanning tools to scan the 10.5.5.0/24 LAN for potential targets for SMB enumeration.

      smbclient -L //10.5.5.14/24
  or

      nmap -p139, 445 --open 10.5.5.0/24

- Which host on the 10.5.5.0/24 network has open ports indicating it is likely running SMB services?

      139 and 445
# Step 2: Determine which SMB directories are shared and can be accessed by anonymous users.
- Use a tool to scan the device that is running SMB and locate the shares that can be accessed by anonymous users.

      smbclient //10.5.5.14/IPC$ -N
      smbclient //10.5.5.14/homes -N
      smbclient //10.5.5.14/print$ -N
      smbclient //10.5.5.14/workfiles -N

- What shares are listed on the SMB server? Which ones are accessible without a valid user login?

      Home, workfiles, print$, IPC$
      workfiles, print$
# Step 3: Investigate each shared directory to find the file.
- Use the SMB-native client to access the drive shares on the SMB server. Use the dir, ls, cd, and other commands to find subdirectories and files.
- Locate the file with the Challenge 3 code. Download the file and open it locally

- In which share is the file found?

      Print$

- use "get" to download file

      get  sxij42.txt
- Type "exit" to quit

      exit
- use "cat" to read file

      cat sxij42.txt
- What is the name of the file with Challenge 3 code?

      sxij42.txt

- Enter the code for Challenge 3 below.

# Step 4: Research and propose SMB attack remediation.
## What are two remediation methods for preventing SMB servers from being accessed?
  - Restrict Network Access to SMB (Firewall & Network Segmentation): Blocks SMB traffic (ports 445 and 139) from untrusted networks to prevents external attackers from even reaching the SMB service.
  - Enforce Strong Authentication & Access Controls: Ensures only authorized users can access SMB shares, this stops unauthorized users even if the SMB server is reachable.
